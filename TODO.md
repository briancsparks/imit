# To Do

## When Last Quit Working on Project

- `immit aider` puts the aider config into the root correctly, though not automated testing
- I started `immit project` - Seems to work, but it is just hacked in.
- Told Aider to refactor the 2 `index.js` files - don't know how good of a job it did.
- Now, I am adding unit tests

## Adding Unit Tests

- Intending to use Jest and Snapshots.
- Where to the output files (the ones generated when testing) should go.
